# Virtual Private Cloud
## What is a VPC?
A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a private network dedicated for your use. You have full control over your VPC. For example, you can specify the CIDR block and configure route tables and gateways. In a VPC, you can deploy Alibaba Cloud resources, such as Elastic Compute Service (ECS) instances, ApsaraDB RDS instances, and Server Load Balancer (SLB) instances.

Furthermore, you can connect your VPC to other VPCs or on-premises networks through Express Connect circuits to create a custom network environment. This way, you can migrate applications to the cloud and extend data centers.
